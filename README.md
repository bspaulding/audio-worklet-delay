# learning DSP via WebAudio

Hi! :wave: I am trying to learn DSP / audio programming. I know JS, so I am using this repo to build some standard effects from scratch with WebAudio.

Most of these will be implemented as AudioWorkletProcessor's. 

## Effects

- :white_check_mark: Delay
- :white_check_mark: BufferSource.
  - I implemented my own to support play/stop without resetting the entire node like AudioBufferSourceNode.
- Compressor is WIP.
- EQ is TODO
- Reverb is TODO
