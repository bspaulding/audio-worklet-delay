# learning DSP via WebAudio

Hi! :wave: I am trying to learn DSP / audio programming. I know JS, so I am using this repo to build some standard effects from scratch with WebAudio.

Most of these will be implemented as AudioWorkletProcessor's. 

## Node Types

Node Type|Status|Notes
------|------|------
Delay|:white_check_mark:
BufferSource|:white_check_mark:|I implemented my own to support play/stop without resetting the entire node like AudioBufferSourceNode.
Compressor|WIP|
EQ|TODO|
Reverb|TODO|
WaveShaper|TODO|
Diode Clipper|TODO|
Synthesizer|TODO|
